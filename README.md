# Flashback

## Inspiration & Description
Early in the pandemic when social isolation was at its peak, I frequently found myself looking through old photos to recall memories with friends and family. Often times, I had specific memories I wanted to find photos for – such as a weekend at a friend’s cottage, my high school graduation, or a trip to Europe the previous summer – but the photo platforms I used could not facilitate detailed searches of images. Put simply, I could not search my memories as I had remembered them. I tried to solve this problem with Flashback, a web application that enables you to upload individual or collections of memories and tag them with details you associate with that memory. This tagging powered a search-rank algorithm that allowed users to search memories as they had remembered them using natural language. I also thought discovery of old memories would be a nice addition to this app, so I also built a feature called ‘Memory Lane’, which randomly serves up to 6 of your uploaded memories.

## Technologies
The frontend of this application was built with **React.js** and the backend was built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. **PostgreSQL** was used as the application's database management system.
